# üõ°Ô∏è Admin Service ‚Äî Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform

The Admin Service handles all moderation, governance, and internal operations for the e-commerce platform. It empowers internal users like admin and super_admin to review seller applications, moderate product listings, manage user roles, and track platform-wide activity.

This service is built within a modern Nx monorepo using scalable microservices architecture. It integrates Prisma ORM, Kafka (event-driven), RBAC via JWT, Redis, and OpenAPI docs to provide a robust and production-ready backend system.
